        C
If this life is one act
          G              G#m
Why do we lay all these traps
            Am
We put them right in our path
              F
When we just wanna be free

            C
I will not waste my days
          G             G#m
Making up all kinds of ways
         Am
To worry about some things
              F
That will not happen to me


     Dm                 Em
So I just let go of what I know I don't know
      F              G²
And I know I'll only do this by


[Chorus]

              C
Living in the moment
             G       G#m
Living my life
           Am
Easy and breezy
                   F
With peace in my mind
                   C
I got peace in my heart
                 G     G#m
Got peace in my soul
               Am                F
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
                C
Living in the moment


[Verse]

             C                       G           G#m
I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
         Am
I let my past go past
               F
And now I'm having more fun
            C           
I'm letting go of the thoughts
               G         G#m
That do not make me strong
      Am                                  F
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone

         Dm            Em               F                  G²
And if I fall asleep I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me


[Chorus]

                 C
To live in the moment
             G    G#m
To live my life
           Am
Easy and breezy
                  F                 
With peace in my mind
                    C
I got peace in my heart
                 G    G#m
Got peace in my soul
               Am                       F
Wherever I'm going-going, I'm already home


[Verse 4]

         Em          Am   Dm  Em   F      G²
I can't walk through life   fa--cing   back--wards
Em     Am      Dm           Em      F         G²
I have tried I tried more than once to just make sure
    Em     Am       F²  
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
   Fm
I spun around and searched no more


[Chorus]

              C
By living in the moment
             G       G#m
Living my life
           Am
Easy and breezy
                   F
With peace in my mind
                   C
I got peace in my heart
                 G     G#m
Got peace in my soul
               Am                F
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
                C
Living in the moment
