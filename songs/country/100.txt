VERSE:

   Am                      C
When I'm blowin out the candles
       Am                   C
and when people start to sing
        Am               C
I will always cross my fingers tight
    Am              C
I remember everything
   

CHORUS:
      
        F               Am
But I always make my wishes
          C               Em
for the same thing every time
      F               C
If I live to be one hundred
     Dm7              C      C  G 
If I ever it getting right  


VERSE:

    Am                     C
My mind is racing with thoughts
          Am              C
and the songs that never end
        Am                 C
and I prayed to God last night
       Am             C
just before I went to bed
         

 
     F              Am
Even now I can't remember
     C            Em
a single word He said
      Am               C
If I live to be one hundred
      G                 C
If I get it through my head

CHORUS: 

    F                Am
I always think about you
       C               Em
and I have to close my eyes
      F              C
If I live to be one hundred
       Dm7               C
Will I ever cross your mind

VERSE:

        Am                    C
When you close your eyes at night
       Am                C
and you rise above your life
      Am                         C
Do you notice there's an empty space
       Am                C
where I wasn't by your side

 
         F                   Am
Because I always dream about you
        C             Em
Every time I close my eyes
       Am              C
If I live to be one hundred
        G               C
Will I ever cross your mind

CHORUS: 

     F             Am

If I live to be one hundred

Will I ever cross your mind
