     C
Some rights and some wrongs, 

some heroes and songs, 
    Dm
are much better left unsolved.
        G
Between fiction and fact, 

illusion and pact, 
            C
where we've been into what we've become.

  C
Although we have changed,

we're never estranged,
            Dm
and there's nothing I'd trade from before,
  F           C          Em      
I love you my friend, my dear means to an 
Am
end,
           F         G         C  
but you're not in my dreams anymore.

     C
I'll never ally, 

all the voices goodbye,
       Dm
to the magical mystery tour.
         G
Keep the tears that I cried,

in my youth and my pride,
        C
and the sorrow like never before.
         C
I've got thank you's and smiles,

and affection for miles,
      Dm
and I always will look unto you.
         G
You held open the door,

for who I'm sent here for,
        C
to come in and make my dreams come true.
  C
Although it was sad,

and it hurt 'cause it had to,
        Dm
there's nothing I'd change from before,
  F           C          Em
I love you my friend, my dear means to an
Am
end,
           F         G         C
but you're not in my dreams anymore.

  C    
Although it was sad,

and it hurt really bad,
        Dm
there's nothing I'd change from before,
  F           C          Em
I love you my friend, my dear means to an F#m
end,
           F         G         C
but you're not in my dreams anymore.
       F         G         C
You're not in my dreams anymore..
