Am F
[Verse]

Am                                       F
Last night I had the exact same dream as you
F                  C                   G                Am
I killed a bird to save your life, and you gave me your shoes,
F                        C                  F      (C/B)     Dm
Said, "clip my wings and walk my miles" and I said "I would, too."
            G                       C
Then I woke up, and wasn't going to tell you.

C                                  F
Today I sang the same damn tune as you.
F                      C                   G                Am
It was "Lady in Red", I hate that song, and I know you do, too
F                    C                    F      (C/B)     Dm
You didn't catch me singing along, but I always sing with you
          G                              C
Nice and quietly, cause I don't want to stop you.


[Chorus]

F                 G                 Am                 F    
I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
F                         G            E              Am
But "time" and "too much" don't belong together like we do
F               G                E7               Am     F
If I had all my yesterdays, I'd give them to you, too.
Am               F    Am          F
I belong to you, now. I belong to you. 


[Verse]

Am                                          F
I see the world the exact same way that you do.
F                     C                   G             Am
We lend our hands and take our stands in tandem when we do.
       F                 C              F     (C/B)     Dm
When I lied and said I knew the way, I hid my eyes from you.
                   G                               C
I still don't know why, I probably didn't want to scare you.


[Chorus]

F                 G                 Am                 F    
I know I could be spending a little too much time with you
F                         G               E              Am
But "time" and "too much" don't belong together like we do
F               G                E7               Am     F
If I had all my yesterdays, I'd give them to you, too.
Am               F    Am          F
I belong to you, now. I belong to you. 


[Verse]

Am                                   F
I'm gonna die the exact same day as you.
          F                     C                   G           Am
On the Golden Gate Bridge, I'll hold your hand and howl at the moon.
  F                 C                F     (C/B)     Dm
Scrape the sky with tired eyes, and I will come find you.
               G                            C
And I ain't scared, cause I am never gonna miss you.


[Outro]

            Am    F                C    G/B
I belong to you, now. I belong to you.
            Am    F                C    G/B
I belong to you, now. I belong to you.

            Am    F                C    G/B
I belong to you, now. I belong to you.           (7X)
