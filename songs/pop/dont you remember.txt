Capo on first fret
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
D                   G
When will I see you again?
                 D              Dsus            G
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
         D       Dsus        G
No final kiss to seal anything
         D           Dsus          G
I had no idea of the state we were in.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
                E
I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
      G                    A
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              D Dsus G            D Dsus G
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
                     D Dsus  G
The reason you loved me   before, 
                 D   A       D
Baby please remember me once more.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D                                     G
When was the last time you thought of me?
            D                                    G
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
              D                           G
Cause I often think about where I want to roam.
           D              G
You more I do, the less I know.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
                    E
But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
      G                    A
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              D Dsus G            D Dsus G
But don't you remember, don't you remember,
                     D Dsus  G
The reason you loved me   before, 
                 D   A       D
Baby please remember me once more.
 
Ohhhh
 
 
[Bridge]
 
F
I gave you the space so you could breathe, 
          G
I kept my distance so you would be free,
F
I hope that you find the missing piece
   G
To bring you back to me.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              D Dsus G            D Dsus G
Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
                     D Dsus  G
The reason you loved me   before, 
                 D   A       D
Baby please remember me once more.
D                   G
When will I see you again?
