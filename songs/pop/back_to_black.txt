Em  Am  C   B

[Verse 1]
Em                     Am
 He left no time to re-gret,
              C                           B
Kept his dick wet, with his same old safe bet.
Em                 Am
 Me... and my head high,
             C                   B
And my tears dry; get on without my guy.

[Verse 2]
Em                         Am
 You went back to what you knew,
       C                              B
So far removed, from all that we went through.
    Em                    Am
And I... tread a troubled track,
            C                     B
My odds are stacked; I'll go back to black.

[Chorus 1]
Em                         Am
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
C                      B             N.C.    Em
 You go back to her and I go back to...I go back to us.

 
[Verse 3]
Em          Am
 I love you much,
           C                          B
It's not e-nough; you love blow and I love puff.
    Em             Am
And life is like a pipe,
               C                          B
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside.

[Chorus 2]
Em                         Am
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
C                       B
 You go back to her and I go back to...
Em                         Am
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
C                       B
 You go back to her and I go back to...

[Break]
N.C.

[Bridge 1]
Em        Cmaj7
 Black... black,
G         B
 Black... black.
Em        Cmaj7
 Black... black,
G         B              B7
 Black... I go back to... I go back to...

 
[Chorus 3]
Em                         Am
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
C                       B
 You go back to her and I go back to...
Em                         Am
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
C                       B            Em
 You go back to her and I go back to black.
