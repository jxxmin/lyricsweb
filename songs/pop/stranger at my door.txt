Am              Dm            Am
I have seen the firewatcherâ€™s daughter.
Am              Dm                Am
watching fires burn from smoke to black.
        F                 G          C    G/B    Am
there's nothing she won't burn, from Styrofoam to urns.
   E7/B
to someone else's ashes in a sack...  (..oh god i love her)

Am                  Dm            Am
You can scorch the metal, you can even melt the glass.
F                                Am
You can pass the time here, fire lives into the past
    F            G             C         G/B  Am
An all-consuming flame, that refines and new begins 
      E7/B                                  E    D    C  B   Am
It'll take your family heirlooms, but it can take your darkest sins
       F                                Am
It's a good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die
        G                                   Am
And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes
   F
Condemn their sons to Hades
        Am                             Dm
And Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well
                   E7/B                     Am
But there ain't no hell for a firewatcher's daughter

[Verse]
    Am          Dm            Am
We exercise the demons of the things we used to know
    F                                Am
The gnashing of the teeth become the remnants of our homes
   F                G          C   G/B      Am
We think we're moving on, from materials we long
   E7                       Am
To forget we ever sold our souls to own
           Am            Dm               Am
There's a chilling absolution that we're given from our birth
  F        G/B           Am
A powerful delusion and a plague upon the earth
    F                 G
But nothing scares me more
         C        G/B  Am
Than the stranger at my door
      E7/B                           Am
Who I fail to give shelter, time, and worth
       F                                Am
It's a good ol' bedtime story, give you nightmares 'til you die
        G                                   Am
And the ones that love to tell it, hide the mischief in their eyes
   F
Condemn their sons to Hades
        Am                              Dm
And Gehenna is full of guys, alive and well
                   E7/B                      Am
But there ain't no hell for a firewatcher's daughter
