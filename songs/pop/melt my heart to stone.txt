Em    A       D            Bm              Em
Right under my feet there’s air made of bricks 
A        D             Bm        Em
Pulls me down turns me weak for you 
A             D               Bm
I find myself repeating like a broken tune 
Em      A       D             D7
And I’m forever excusing your intentions
G                   F#
And I give in to my pretendings 
Bm            F#7      Bm
Which forgive you each time 
D          Em7
Without me knowing 
A                     D
They melt my heart to stone 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                Bm        Em       A
And I hear your words that I made up 
                Bm        Em        A
You say my name like there could be an us 
                Bm         Em        A       D7
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love 
G                F#
I’m the only one in love 
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em     A       D     Bm              Em
Each and every time I turn around to leave 
A         D              Bm        Em
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed 
A              D                Bm
So desperately I try to link it with my head 
G             A               D
But instead I fall back to my knees 
       D7                  G
As you tear your way right through me 
  F#          F#7   Bm
I forgive you once again 
D          Em7
Without me knowing 
A                        D
You’ve burnt my heart to stone 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                Bm         Em     A
And I hear your words that I made up 
                     Bm          Em    A
You say my name like there could be an us 
                  Bm           Em   A      D7
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love 
G                F#
I’m the only one in love 
 
 
[Bridge]
 
B          Amaj7
Why do you steal my hand 
B                           Amaj7
Whenever I’m standing my own ground 
G            D                 F#  F#sus4
You build me up, then leave me dead 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 Bm    Em       A
Well I hear your words you made up 
                     Bm           Em    A
I say your name like there should be an us 
                  Bm           Em   A      D7
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love 
G                F#
I’m the only one in love.
