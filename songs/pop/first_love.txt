F           Cmaj7
So little to say

But so much time
   Em
Despite my empty mouth
                 Am
The words are in my mind
      F
Please wear the face
                  Cmaj7
The one where you smile

Because you
        Em
Lighten up my heart
                Am
When I start to cry


[Chorus]
           F
Forgive me first love
       Cmaj7
But I'm tired
          Em
I need to get away
        Am
To feel again
                  F
Try to understand why
            Cmaj7
Don't get so close

To change my mind


[Pre-Chorus]
                 Em
Please wipe that look

Out of your eyes

It's bribing me
Am
To doubt myself
F            Cmaj7
Simply, it's tiring

F  Cmaj7  Em  Am


[Verse]
              Em
This love has dried up
           Am
And stayed behind
         F
And if I stay
         Cmaj7
Itâ€™d be a lie
              Em
Then choke on words
          Am
I'd always hide
          F
Excuse me first love
          Cmaj7
But we're through
          Em
I need to taste the kiss
             Am
From someone new


[Chorus]
           F
Forgive me first love
           Cmaj7
But I'm too tired
    Em
I'm bored to say

The least and I
       Am
I lack desire


F  Cmaj7  Em  Am


Forgive me first love (4x)
Forgive me
Forgive me first love (2x)
