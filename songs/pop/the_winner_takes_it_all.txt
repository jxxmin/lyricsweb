                G
I don't wanna talk
                        D
About the things we've gone through
                Am
Though it's hurting me
                D
Now it's history

                G
I've played all my cards
                        D
And that's what you've done too
                Am
Nothing more to say
                D
No more ace to play


[Chorus]

                G
The winner takes it all
                Em7
The loser standing small
                Am
Beside the victory
                D
That's her destiny


[Verse]

                G
I was in your arms
                        D
Thinking I belonged there
                Am
I figured it made sense
                D
Building me a fence

                G
Building me a home
                        D
Thinking I'd be strong there
                Am
But I was a fool
                D
Playing by the rules


[Bridge]

                G
The gods may throw a dice
                 Em7
Their minds as cold as ice
                Am
And someone way down here
                D
Loses someone dear


[Chorus]

                G
The winner takes it all
                 Em7
The loser has to fall
                Am
It's simple and it's plain
                D
Why should I complain.


[Verse]

                G
But tell me does she kiss
                D
Like I used to kiss you?
                Am
Does it feel the same
                D
When she calls your name?

                G
Somewhere deep inside
                D
You must know I miss you
                Am
But what can I say
                D
Rules must be obeyed

[Bridge 2]
                G
The judges will decide
                Em7
The likes of me abide
                Am
Spectators of the show
                D
Always staying low


[Chorus]

                G
The game is on again
                 Em7
A lover or a friend
                Am
A big thing or a small
                D
The winner takes it all


[Verse]

                G
I don't wanna talk
                D
If it makes you feel sad
                Am
And I understand
                D
You've come to shake my hand

                G
I apologize
                D
If it makes you feel bad
                Am
Seeing me so tense
                D
No self-confidence
D
But you see


[Outro]

                G
The winner takes it all
                D
The winner takes it all..
