G                          Em                        C
I went out looking for the answers and never left my town. 
                    G                                  D
I’m no good at understanding, but I’m good at standing ground. 
 G                         Em
And when I asked a corner preacher I couldn’t hear him for my 
C                       G                           D
youth. Some people get religion some people get the truth. I
               C                      G
never get the truth, I never get the truth.
 
Chorus:
Bm                            C                                G
I know the darkness falls on you. And it’s just a point of view
                            D                Em
When you’re outside looking in you belong to someone and when 
                      C                       Am
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your 
                    C (Strum)            G
heart can break in two, someone loves you.
 
 
G                         Em                                C
I lay this suitcase on my chest so I can feel somebody’s weight. 
                 G                             D
And I lay you to rest just to feel a give and take? 
G                        Em                             C
I got a new interpretation and it’s a better point of view, you 
                    G                              D
were looking for a landslide I was looking out for you, I was 
                 C                               G
looking out for you, someone’s looking out for you
 
Chorus:
Bm                            C                                G
I know the darkness falls on you. And it’s just a point of view
                            D                Em
When you’re outside looking in you belong to someone and when 
                     C                       Am

Bridge
G (strum)                     Em (strum)
I am afraid of crossing lines. I am afraid of flying blind.
 
C (strum)                  G(Strum)               D(strum)
afraid of inquiring minds. Afraid of being left behind.
 
G                             Em                           C
I close my eyes I think of you, I take a step I think of you, 
                               G                             D
I catch my breath I think of you, I cannot rest I think of you
 
Last Chorus

My one and only wrecking ball, and you’re cutting through my

walls. When you’re outside looking in you belong to someone and 
                          C                         Am
when you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like 
                          C                    G
your heart could break in two, someone loves you.
