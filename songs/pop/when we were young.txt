[Intro]
Am   Em    F   C/E
Dm       C
 
[Verse 1]
Am          Em                   F    C/E
  Everybody loves the things you do
                  Dm                  C
 From the way you talk to the way you move
Am          Em              F      C/E
  Everybody here is watching  you
                     Dm                            C        C C/B
 Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come  true
 
Am          Em                  F     C/E
  But if by chance you're here alone
              Dm              C    C C/B
 Can I have a moment before I go
Am                   Em               F     C/E
  Cause I've been by myself all night long
               Dm                Gsus4  G
 Hoping you're someone I used to know
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                  F      G
 You look like a movie
                  Em     F
 You sound like a song
               F         G
 My God this reminds me
                 Em     G
 Of when we were young
 
[Chorus]
        C              Em                F              G
 Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time
         C          Em            F              G
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
          Am            C/E             F         Fm
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
                    Dm     F                    Gsus4  G
 It was just like a movie,   it was just like a song
 
[Verse 2]
Am          Em                F      C/E
   I was so scared to face my fears
              Dm                    C      C C/B
 Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
Am            Em            F     C/E
  And I swear you moved overseas
                Dm                   Gsus4 G
 That's what you  said when you left me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                        F     G
 You still look like a movie
                        Em    F
 You still sound like a song
               F         G
 My God this reminds me
                 Em     G
 Of when we were young
 
[Chorus]
        C              Em                F              G
 Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time
         C          Em            F              G
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
          Am            C/E             F         Fm
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
                    Dm     F                    G     G/Ab
 It was just like a movie,   it was just like a song
 
[Bridge]
      Am            C/G
 When we were young
      F             C/E
 When we were young
      Am            C/G
 When we were young
      F             G/Ab
 When we were young
 
      Am      C/G         F               C/E
 It's hard to admit that, everything just takes me back
         Dm
 To when you were there
         G              G/Ab
 To when you were there
       Am               C/G         F               C/E
 And a part of me keeps holding on, just in case it hasn't gone
         Dm
 I guess I still care
    G
 Do you still care?
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                     F     G
 It was just like a movie
                    Em    F
 It was just like a song
               F         G
 My God this reminds me
                 Em     G
 Of when we were young
 
[Bridge]
      C             Em
 When we were young
      F             G
 When we were young
      C             Em
 When we were young
      F             G
 When we were young
 
[Chorus]
        C              Em                F              G
 Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time
         C          Em            F              G
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
         Am             C/E             F       G
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
            Am              C/E              F        Fm
 Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
                    Dm     F                    Gsus4 G
 It was just like a movie,   it was just like a song
               C
 When we were young
