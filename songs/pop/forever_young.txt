C                G                      Am
  Let's start in style, let's dance for a while
           F                            G
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
               Am                      F
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
                       G6 - FMaj7 - G6 - C
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?


C                G                      Am
Let us stay young or let us live forever
           F                            G
We don't have the power, but we never say never
               Am                      F
Sitting in the sandpit, life is a short trip
                       G6 - FMaj7 - G6 - C
The music's for the sadman


C                G                      Am
Can you imagine when this race is won
           F                            G
Turn out all the faces into the sun
               Am                      F
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
                       G6 - FMaj7 - G6 - C
The music's played by the madman


[Chorus]

C         G
  Forever Young
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                      Am
 Do you really want to live forever?
F       G
 Forever, you'll never
C         G
  Forever Young,
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                     Am
Do you really want to live forever?
F  G         C
     Forever Young.


[Verse]

C                G                      Am
Some are like water, some are like the heat
           F                            G
Some are a melody and some are the beat
               Am                      F
Sooner or later they all will be gone
                       G6 - FMaj7 - G6 - C
Why don't they stay young?


C                G                      Am
It's so hard to get old without a cause
           F                            G
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
               Am                      F
Years like diamonds in the sun
                       G6 - FMaj7 - G6 - C
And diamonds are forever


C                G                      Am
So many advantages given up today
           F                            G
So many songs we forgot to play
               Am                      F
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
                       G6 - FMaj7 - G6 - C
Oh let it come true


[Chorus]

C         G
  Forever Young
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                      Am
 Do you really want to live forever?
F       G
 Forever, you'll never
C         G
  Forever Young,
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                     Am
Do you really want to live forever?
F  G         C
     Forever Young.


[Solo]


[Chorus]

C         G
  Forever Young
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                      Am
 Do you really want to live forever?
F       G
 Forever, you'll never
C         G
  Forever Young,
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                     Am
Do you really want to live forever?
F  G         C
     Forever Young.
