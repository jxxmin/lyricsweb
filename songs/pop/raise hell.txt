Capo 2
 
This is a much easier alternative to the chords already on the site here.
However, "arpoe" really nailed the solo so 5 star rating to them for that!
 
Intro: Am
 
Am
I've been down with a broken heart
 
Since the day I learned to speak
 
The devil gave me a crooked start
 
When he gave me crooked feet
 
But Gabriel done came to me
    D               Am
And kissed me in my sleep
 
And I'll be singing like an angel
                       Am
Until I'm six feet deep
 
Am                           D             Am
I found myself an omen and I tattooed on a sign
                                 D             Am
I set my mind to wandering and I walk a broken line
 
You have a mind to keep me quiet
    D                Am
And although you can try
 
Better men have hit their knees
    E               Am
And bigger men have died
 
          G        Am
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
          G            Am
There's a story no one tells
          D        Am
You gotta raise, raise hell
   D      E         Am
Go on and ring that bell
 
Am
You came upon a lightning strike
    D                    Am
And eyes of bright clear blue
 
I took a tie from around my neck
    D                Am
And gave my heart to you
 
I sent my love across the sea
    D               Am
And though I didn't cry
 
That voice will haunt my every dream
  E             Am
Until the day I die
 
 
          G        Am
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
          G            Am
There's a story no one tells
          D           Am
You gotta raise, oh raise hell
   D      Em        Am
Go on and ring that bell
 
 
I dug a hole inside my heart
 
To put you in your grave
 
At this point it was you and me
    E7
And mama didn't raise no slave
    Am
You took my face in both your hands
    E                Am
And looked me in the eye
 
And I went down with such a force
 
That in your grave I lie
 
          G        Am
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
          G            Am
There's a story no one tells
          D        Am
You gotta raise, raise hell
   D      Em        Am
Go on and ring that bell
   D      Em        Am
Go on and ring that bell
   D      Em        Am
Go on and ring that bell
   D            Em      Am
Go on and ring that bell
