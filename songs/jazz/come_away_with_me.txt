C   Am7   C   Am7   C   Am7   C   Am7


[Verse 1]
C             Am7                   C     Am7
    Come away with me   in the night
C             Am7                Em          Fsus2      C     G
    Come away with me   And I will   write   you a song


[Verse 2]
C         Am7                 C     Am7
    Come away with me on a bus
C          Am7                 Em      Fsus2           C
    Come away where they can't tempt   us   With their lies


[Chorus 1]
G             Fsus2         C
  And I wanna walk with you     On a cloudy day
G                     Fsus2                   C
  In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
            G           C
So won't you   try   to come


[Verse 4]
             Am7                 C             Am7
    Come away  with me and we'll kiss     On a mountaintop
C            Am7                Em        Fsus2         C     G
     Come away  with me And I'll    never stop   loving you


[Instrumental]
C    Am7    C    Am7    C    Am7    Em7    Fsus2    C   G
C    Am7    C    Am7    C    Am7    Em7    Fsus2    C


[Chorus 2]
G               Fsus2              C
  And I want to wake up   with the rain  falling on a tin roof
G           Fsus2                  C
  While I'm safe there  in your arms
         G            C
So all I   ask is for you


[Outro Verse]
             Am7                 C   Am7
to come away with me  in the night
C            G            C
    Come away      with me
